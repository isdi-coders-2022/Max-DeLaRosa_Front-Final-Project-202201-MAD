## Surftrip Frontend

This is my Surftrip application's frontend, built using Angular and NgRX for state mangament.

It has view for both types of users: surfcamps and surfers.

Surfcamps will be able to register and add their information, as well as photos and packages.

Surfers will be able to register as normal users and search for surfcamps and packages.
